# PBI-Call-Centre-Data-Analytics
Descriptive Analysis

The aim of the project was to create a dashboard in Power BI for Call Centre Manager
that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
The dashboard uncovers long term trends in customer and agent behavior which will
serve as basis for discussion with management
